We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we\\'re \"old\" (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we\\'re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can\\'t put us in a box But \"Digital Transformation\" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don\\'t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That\\'s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S. and/or Canada: When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate\\'s hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process. U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.

We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program. Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components.

No third-party assistance is approved for this role.\\n\\nAbout The Job: At Jaxon, we are on a mission to make AI trustworthy. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in corporate settings is hindered by the “hallucination problem,” where AI models produce inaccurate or entirely fabricated responses. For regulated industries and high-risk applications, this issue is preventing LLM use altogether. This role is crucial in overcoming these challenges.\\n\\nAs a Machine Learning Engineer at Jaxon, you will be responsible for developing and implementing machine learning models and algorithms to create more reliable AI systems. You will play a key role in delivering complex AI-driven solutions for customers, with a particular focus on defense applications as Jaxon is dual-use.\\n\\nWe have a patent pending product, Domain-Specific AI Logic (DSAIL), that forms the basis of most of our deployments. This role will be focused on increasing security and reliability for our customers through implementing DSAIL and building on its capabilities. A particular emphasis is placed on addressing the fundamental limitations of LLMs – they don’t understand context and logical reasoning. Once an LLM deviates from the right path, errors are more likely to occur. Training an AI away from this type of yes/no logic and into more human-like reasoning is at the core of this position.\\n\\nThe Basics Of This Role Requires The Ability To\\n• Collaborate Across Teams: Work with cross-functional teams to integrate ML models into our existing systems and workflows, enhancing product capabilities.\\n• Optimize Data Processing and Model Performance: Conduct comprehensive data management including preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to improve accuracy and efficiency.\\n• Technical Proficiency: Demonstrate solid machine learning engineering experience, particularly with NLP applications and unstructured data in a cloud environment. Fluency in Python is essential.\\n• Understand Machine Learning Models: Needs to be intimately familiar with the process, but deploying ML models will not be a regular part of the job.\\n• Soft Skills:\\n• Able to context switch as needed\\n• Able to compartmentalize different projects with different goals\\n• Able to communicate clearly and precisely - not just abstractions and \"lines-and-boxes\"\\n\\nSpecific Technologies\\n• Docker, Docker Compose\\n• Python\\n• Python Data Science Stack - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Various deep learning packages\\n• Familiarity with calling web API\\'s and making web API\\'s\\n• Familiarity with modular architectures - IPC, publish-subscribe, etc…\\n\\nNice-To-Haves\\n• Familiarity with predicate logic\\n• Familiarity with Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation for language grammars\\n• Lisp languages\\n\\nAbout Jaxon: Jaxon is a leading provider of machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions. We are committed to helping our customers solve complex problems with AI. Our products and services are used by businesses of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.\\n\\nWhat Makes Jaxon Different?\\n• Human First: Our leaders get it — life happens. Whether it’s flexible working hours or understanding the need for a mental health day, we prioritize your well-being. Our CEO recognizes that happy people do the best work and he backs that up with an empathetically led culture – and I’m not just saying that because he’s going to read this post.\\n• Laid-Back Culture: We know that the best work comes from a place of comfort and authenticity. At Jaxon, you’re encouraged to be yourself, dress casually, and embrace your quirky side. It’s just one of the benefits of being an early-stage, high-growth startup.\\n• Tech Lover\\'s Dream: From hackathons to tech talks with industry leaders, we fuel our passion for innovation with constant learning and development opportunities.\\n• Grunt Work to Grand Projects: Every task you tackle, big or small, matters. You think I’m writing job descriptions for fun? Sometimes things need to get done and it’s an all hands on deck situation to get them to the finish line. We\\'re looking for team players who understand that achieving groundbreaking AI innovations sometimes involves rolling up your sleeves to tackle the essential, yet less glamorous tasks.\\n• Excited about the prospect of free snacks, massages, and a hot tub at the office? You might have to keep looking, as we\\'re a fully remote team. However, if you ever feel the need to switch up your work environment, you’re always welcome at our office space in Lincoln, Massachusetts—includes a dartboard and BBQ!\\n\\nAdded Perks\\n• Unlimited PTO: (seriously!)\\n• Comprehensive benefits: Health, dental, and vision insurance\\n• Competitive Salary: We provide competitive compensation packages commensurate with experience\\n• Stock Options: All compensation plans include stock options - join now and benefit from future acquisitions\\n• Holidays Off: ALL federal holidays are paid time off.\\n\\nAbout You: You\\'re the type of person who\\'s naturally driven—not necessarily because you built a rocket in your backyard as a kid, but because you have a genuine curiosity about the world of technology. In your spare time, you might find yourself deep-diving into technology subreddits, following the latest industry trends, or exploring which companies are innovating and how. Your passion isn\\'t just about staying informed; it\\'s about thinking how you can take these emerging concepts and scale them up, make them faster, or more impactful. At Jaxon, we\\'re looking for someone who sees a baseline and instinctively wants to build beyond it. If you’re ready to take what exists and make it extraordinary, you’ll fit right in.\\n\\nJob Description\\n\\nThe engineering team at Jaxon warned me that all engineers hate when job descriptions specify bullet lists of X years of experience in technology Y such that time_exists(Y) < X. With that being said, there are no hard tech requirements, but experience with the python ML ecosystem and with LLMs is expected. Additionally:\\n• You should have a comfort level building and training models, not just calling cloud APIs, but you’re resourceful enough to recognize when you can use cloud APIs whenever you can get away with it.\\n• You aren’t afraid of digesting academic papers, but you understand that it’s code that matters.\\n• You’re going to need proven expertise in building ML applications.\\n• Proficient Python including demonstrable experience with libraries relevant to data manipulation.\\n• Ideally some experience with machine learning, in particular NLP applications.\\n• You are primarily in a development role, but are comfortable being customer-facing when needed.\\n• Active security clearance is a bonus.\\n\\nWe are looking for somebody who thrives in an environment where day-to-day priorities and tasks may rapidly change. The role is not a fit if you value \"business as usual\".\\n\\nWe value team members who are bold enough to pitch creative ideas, even if they\\'re still rough around the edges or might not make the final cut.\\n\\nEducation And Length Of Experience\\n\\nPreferably applicants will have a bachelor\\'s degree in Computer Science or similar, however at Jaxon, we value skills and dedication over degrees.
